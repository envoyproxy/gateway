This task walks you through installing Envoy Gateway in your Kubernetes cluster.

The manual install process does not allow for as much control over configuration
as the [Helm install method](./install-helm), so if you need more control over your Envoy Gateway
installation, it is recommended that you use helm.

    ```

2. Next Steps

   Envoy Gateway should now be successfully installed and running, but in order to experience more abilities of Envoy Gateway, you can refer to [Tasks](/latest/tasks).

## Upgrading from a previous version

Some manual migration steps are required to upgrade Envoy Gateway.

1. Update Gateway-API and Envoy Gateway CRDs:

```shell
helm pull oci://docker.io/envoyproxy/gateway-helm --version {{< yaml-version >}} --untar
kubectl apply --force-conflicts --server-side -f ./gateway-helm/crds/gatewayapi-crds.yaml
kubectl apply --force-conflicts --server-side -f ./gateway-helm/crds/generated
```

2. Install Envoy Gateway {{< yaml-version >}}:

```shell
helm upgrade eg oci://docker.io/envoyproxy/gateway-helm --version {{< yaml-version >}} -n envoy-gateway-system
```

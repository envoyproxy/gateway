# Roadmap

This document serves as a high-level reference for Envoy Gateway users and contributors to understand the direction of
the project.

## Contributing to the Roadmap

- To add a feature to the roadmap, create an [issue][issue] or join a [community meeting][meeting] to discuss your use
  case. If your feature is accepted, a maintainer will assign your issue to a [release milestone][milestones] and update
  this document accordingly.
- To help with an existing roadmap item, comment on or assign yourself to the associated issue.
- If a roadmap item doesn't have an issue, create one, assign yourself to the issue, and reference this document. A
  maintainer will submit a [pull request][PR] to add the feature to the roadmap. __Note:__ The feature should be
  discussed in an issue or a community meeting before implementing it.

If you don't know where to start contributing, help is needed to reduce technical, automation, and documentation debt.
Look for issues with the `help wanted` label to get started.

## Details

Roadmap features and timelines may change based on feedback, community contributions, etc. If you depend on a specific
roadmap item, you're encouraged to attend a community meeting to discuss the details, or help us deliver the feature by
contributing to the project.

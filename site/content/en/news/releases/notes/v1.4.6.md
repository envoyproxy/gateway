## Bug fixes

- Fixed 500 errors caused by partially invalid BackendRefs; traffic is now correctly routed between valid backends and 500 responses according to their configured weights.

## Other changes

- Fixed an memory leak issue where `watchable.Maps`` never closed when shutting down the provider.
- Coalesced updates to reduce intermediate updates.

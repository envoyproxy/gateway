# Changes that are expected to cause an incompatibility with previous versions, such as deletions or modifications to existing APIs.
breaking changes: |
  The Container `ports` field of the gateway instance has been removed, which will cause the gateway Pod to be rebuilt when upgrading the version.
  ClientTrafficPolicy previously treated an empty TLS ALPNProtocols list as being undefined and applied Envoy Gateway defaults.
  An empty TLS ALPNProtocols list is now treated as user-defined disablement of the TLS ALPN extension.
  Always use `::` and `IPv4Compact` enabled on dynamic listeners.
  Use `V4_PREFERRED` instead of `V4_ONLY` by default for the cluster's `DnsLookupFamily`.

bug fixes: |
  Disabled the retry policy for the JWT provider to reduce requests sent to the JWKS endpoint. Failed async fetches will retry every 1s.
  Used a waitGroup instead of an enabled channel in the status updater.

Other changes: |
  EG Listens on IPv4 by default, but if IPFamily is set to IPv6 or DualStack, it listens on :: and enables ipv4_compat for DualStack.
  Bumped Gateway API to v1.2.1.

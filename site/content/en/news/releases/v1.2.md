## What's New

The release adds a ton of features and functionality. Here are some highlights:

---

## üö® Breaking Changes

- **Gateway API Updates**: Removed support for the v1alpha2 versions for `GRPCRoute` and `ReferenceGrant`. [See the Gateway API v1.2.0 documentation](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/releases/tag/v1.2.0) for details.
- **CPU Limits**: Removed default CPU limit for Envoy Gateway deployment to avoid throttling.
- **Envoy Shutdown Settings**: Drain strategy set to immediate, with default values as follows:
  - `minDrainDuration`: 10s
  - `drainTimeout`: 60s
  - `terminationGracePeriodSeconds`: 360s
- **Endpoint Health On Host Removal**: Enabled `ignore_health_on_host_removal` for clusters with static endpoints to allow faster removal of endpoints that have been deleted by the control plane, without waiting for the results of an active health check.
- **Logging Level Adjustment**: Set xDS and Infra IR logs to Debug level instead of Info, so they will no longer appear in Envoy Gateway logs by default. You can change the logging level to `debug` to view them.

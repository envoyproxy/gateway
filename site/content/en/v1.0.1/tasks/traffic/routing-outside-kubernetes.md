title: "Routing outside Kubernetes"
---

Routing to endpoints outside the Kubernetes cluster where Envoy Gateway and its corresponding Envoy Proxy fleet is
running is a common use case. This can be achieved by defining FQDN addresses in a [EndpointSlice][].

## Installation

Follow the steps from the [Quickstart](../../quickstart) to install Envoy Gateway and the example manifest.
Before proceeding, you should be able to query the example backend using HTTP.

## Configuration

Define a Service and EndpointSlice that represents https://httpbin.org

```shell
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: httpbin
  namespace: default
spec:
  ports:
    - port: 443
      protocol: TCP
      targetPort: 443
      name: https
---
apiVersion: discovery.k8s.io/v1
kind: EndpointSlice
metadata:
  name: httpbin
  namespace: default
  labels:
    kubernetes.io/service-name: httpbin 
addressType: FQDN
ports:
- name: https
  protocol: TCP
  port: 443
endpoints:
- addresses:
  - "httpbin.org"
EOF
```

Update the [Gateway][] to include a TLS Listener on port 443

```shell
kubectl patch gateway eg --type=json --patch '
  - op: add
    path: /spec/listeners/-
    value:
      name: tls
      protocol: TLS
      port: 443
      tls:
        mode: Passthrough
  '
```

Add a [TLSRoute][] that can route incoming traffic to the above backend that we created

```shell
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1alpha2
kind: TLSRoute
metadata:
  name: httpbin 
spec:
  parentRefs:
  - name: eg 
    sectionName: tls
  rules:
  - backendRefs:
    - name: httpbin
      port: 443
EOF
```    

Get the Gateway address:

```shell
export GATEWAY_HOST=$(kubectl get gateway/eg -o jsonpath='{.status.addresses[0].value}')
```

Send a request and view the response:

```shell
curl -I -HHost:httpbin.org --resolve "httpbin.org:443:${GATEWAY_HOST}" https://httpbin.org/
```

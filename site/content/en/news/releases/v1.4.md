## What's New

The release adds a ton of features and functionality. Here are some highlights:

---

## üö® Breaking Changes

- **Envoy Readiness Port**: A dedicated listener port (`19003`) is now used for Envoy proxy readiness.
- **Access Log Format**: The default access log now uses the Envoy JSON formatter instead of the plain text formatter.
- **xDS Snapshot Behavior**: Envoy Gateway now skips xDS snapshot updates if errors occur during xDS translation.
- **Extension Manager Behavior**:
  - If `failOpen` is set to `true`, translation errors are logged and suppressed (same as before).
  - If `failOpen` is set to `false`, Envoy Gateway will **skip** xDS updates for affected resources instead of replacing them.

## üêû Bug Fixes

- Fixed traffic splitting when filters are attached to the `backendRef`.
- Added support for `Secret` and `ConfigMap` parsing in standalone mode.
- Bypassed overload manager for stats and ready listeners.
- Fixed translation of `backendSettings` for external authorization.
- Fixed an issue where the stats compressor was not working.
- Added support for [BackendTLSPolicy] and [EnvoyExtensionPolicy] parsing in standalone mode.
- Re-triggered reconciliation when a `backendRef` of type `ServiceImport` is updated or when `EndpointSlice` resources for a `ServiceImport` are updated.
- Fixed missing error logs and returns in the Kubernetes Reconcile method when a `GatewayClass` is not accepted.
- Allowed empty text field for OpenTelemetry sink when using JSON format.
- Fixed an issue where `SamplingFraction` was not working.
- Fixed Kubernetes resources not being deleted when a custom name was used.
- Prevented essential resources like `Namespace` from being treated as missing when loading from file.
- Avoided setting retriable status codes to 503 when `RetryOn` is configured in [BackendTrafficPolicy].
- Allowed the offline Kubernetes controller to use non-default CRDs.
- Fixed an issue when merging a route with multiple `parentRefs`.
- Fixed reconciliation logic to continue processing all `GatewayClasses` even after an error with one.
- Fixed topology injector blocking the Envoy proxy from starting.
- Increased the shutdown-manager's `failureThreshold` to 10 to ensure Envoy restarts before shutdown-manager in case of transient network issues.
- Fixed an issue where a `ReferenceGrant` from a [SecurityPolicy] to a referenced `remoteJWKS` backend was not respected.
- Added validation for header values.
- Added validation to prevent duplicated API keys in API Key Auth.
- Fixed [HTTPRoute] precedence by correctly considering header and query match types.
- Ensured the TLS inspector filter is only added to TCP listeners (not UDP/QUIC) when HTTP/3 is enabled via [ClientTrafficPolicy].

# Reference Architecture

This page provides a comprehensive reference architecture showing how Envoy Gateway integrates into enterprise production environments. It demonstrates typical deployment patterns, infrastructure components, and traffic flows in real-world scenarios.

## Architecture Overview

![Reference Architecture](/img/reference-architecture.svg)

The reference architecture illustrates a multi-tier enterprise deployment with Envoy Gateway serving as the primary ingress gateway, handling north-south traffic into a Kubernetes cluster.

## Architecture Zones

### Internet / External Traffic Zone

This zone represents external traffic sources and edge infrastructure:

- **End Users**: Web browsers, mobile applications, and API clients
- **Partner Systems**: Third-party APIs and B2B integrations  
- **Edge Infrastructure**: CDN, DNS, and cloud load balancers (ALB/NLB)

**Key Considerations:**
- Global traffic distribution via CDN
- DDoS protection and edge security
- DNS-based traffic routing and failover

### Edge / DMZ Zone

The edge zone contains Envoy Gateway components and security infrastructure:

#### Envoy Gateway Control Plane
- **Gateway API Controller**: Manages Gateway, HTTPRoute, and policy resources
- **xDS Configuration Server**: Translates high-level policies to Envoy configuration
- **Resource Validation**: Ensures configuration correctness and security
- **Status Management**: Reports configuration status back to Kubernetes

#### Envoy Proxy Data Plane
- **TLS Termination**: Handles SSL/TLS certificates and encryption
- **Protocol Translation**: HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, HTTP/3 support
- **Load Balancing**: Advanced algorithms and health checking
- **Rate Limiting**: Global and local rate limiting policies

#### Security Layer Integration

#### Monitoring & Analytics
- **Metrics Storage**: Prometheus for time-series data
- **Log Aggregation**: ELK stack for centralized logging
- **APM Tools**: Application performance monitoring

## Traffic Flow Patterns

### North-South Traffic (Ingress)

1. **External Request**: Client initiates HTTPS request
2. **Edge Processing**: CDN and load balancer routing
3. **Gateway Processing**: Envoy Gateway terminates TLS and applies policies
4. **Service Routing**: Request routed to appropriate Kubernetes service
5. **Response Path**: Response flows back through the same path with observability data collected

### Policy Enforcement Points

- **Rate Limiting**: Applied at gateway level with distributed counters
- **Authentication**: JWT validation and OIDC integration
- **Authorization**: Policy-based access control
- **Security Policies**: WAF rules and threat detection
- **Traffic Policies**: Timeouts, retries, and circuit breakers

### Observability Data Flow

- **Metrics**: Prometheus metrics from Envoy proxies
- **Traces**: Distributed tracing through Jaeger/Zipkin
- **Logs**: Structured logs to ELK stack
- **Alerts**: PrometheusAlerts for operational issues

## Deployment Patterns

### High Availability

```yaml
# Example: HA Envoy Gateway deployment
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Gateway
metadata:
  name: production-gateway
spec:
  gatewayClassName: envoy-gateway
  listeners:
  - name: https
    port: 443
    protocol: HTTPS
    hostname: "*.example.com"
    tls:
      mode: Terminate
      certificateRefs:
      - name: example-com-tls
```

**HA Characteristics:**
- Multiple Envoy proxy replicas across availability zones
- Anti-affinity rules for control plane components
- External load balancer health checks
- Automated failover and scaling

### Multi-Environment

```yaml
# Example: Environment-specific routing
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: HTTPRoute
metadata:
  name: app-route
spec:
  parentRefs:
  - name: production-gateway
  hostnames:
  - api.example.com
  rules:
  - matches:
    - path:
        type: PathPrefix
        value: /v1/
    backendRefs:
    - name: api-service-v1
      port: 80
      weight: 90
    - name: api-service-v2
      port: 80
      weight: 10  # Canary deployment
```

### Security Integration

```yaml
# Example: Security policy
apiVersion: gateway.envoyproxy.io/v1alpha1
kind: SecurityPolicy
metadata:
  name: api-security
spec:
  targetRef:
    group: gateway.networking.k8s.io
    kind: HTTPRoute
    name: api-route
  jwt:
    providers:
    - name: auth0
      issuer: "https://example.auth0.com/"
      audiences:
      - "api.example.com"
  cors:
    allowOrigins:
    - "https://app.example.com"
    allowMethods:
    - GET
    - POST
    - PUT
    - DELETE
```

## Scalability Considerations

### Horizontal Scaling

- **Envoy Proxy Replicas**: Scale based on request volume and latency
- **Control Plane Replicas**: Typically 2-3 replicas for HA
- **Resource Allocation**: CPU and memory based on traffic patterns

### Performance Optimization

- **Connection Pooling**: Reuse connections to backend services  
- **Caching**: Response caching and static asset optimization
- **Compression**: gRPC and HTTP response compression
- **Keep-Alive**: Persistent connections to reduce overhead

### Monitoring & Alerting

```yaml
# Example: Envoy Gateway metrics
- alert: EnvoyGatewayHighLatency
  expr: histogram_quantile(0.95, envoy_http_request_duration_seconds) > 0.5
  labels:
    severity: warning
  annotations:
    summary: "High request latency detected"
    description: "95th percentile latency is {{ $value }}s"
```

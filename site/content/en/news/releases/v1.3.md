We are thrilled to announce the arrival of Envoy Gateway v1.3.0.

This release represents a significant achievement, and we extend our heartfelt gratitude to the entire Envoy Gateway community for their contributions, dedication, and support. Your collaborative efforts have been instrumental in reaching this pivotal release.

Thank you for being an integral part of this journey. We are excited to see how Envoy Gateway v1.3.0 will empower your operations and look forward to continuing our work together to drive the future of Cloud Native API Gateway.

## What's New

The release adds a ton of features and functionality. Here are some highlights:

---

## üö® Breaking Changes

- **Proxy Pod Template**: The Container `ports` field of the gateway instance has been removed, which will cause the gateway Pod to be rebuilt when upgrading the version.
- **TLS Defaults**: ClientTrafficPolicy previously treated an empty TLS ALPNProtocols list as being undefined and applied Envoy Gateway defaults. An empty TLS ALPNProtocols list is now treated as user-defined disablement of the TLS ALPN extension.
- **Default Passive Health Checks**: Outlier detection (passive health check) is now disabled by default. Refer to [BackendTrafficPolicy] for working with passive health checks.
- **Extension Manager Fails Closed**: Envoy Gateway treats errors in calls to an extension service as fail-closed by default. Any error returned from the extension server will replace the affected resource with an "Internal Server Error" immediate response. The previous behavior can be enabled by setting the `failOpen` field to `true` in the extension service configuration.
- **ClientTrafficPolicy Translation Failures**: Envoy Gateway now return a 500 response when a ClientTrafficPolicy translation fails for HTTP/GRPC routes, and forwards client traffic to an empty cluster when a ClientTrafficPolicy translation fails for TCP routes.
- **Envoy Proxy Reference Failures**: Any issues with `EnvoyProxy` reference in a `Gateway` will prevent the Envoy fleet from being created or result in the deletion of an existing Envoy fleet.
- **BackendTLSPolicy Translation Failures**: Envoy Gateway now returns a 500 response when a BackendTLSPolicy translation fails for HTTP/GRPC/TLS routes.

## üêû Bug Fixes

- Fixed a panic in the provider goroutine when the body in the direct response configuration was nil.
- Fixed Envoy rejecting TCP Listeners that have no attached TCPRoutes.
- Fixed failed to update [SecurityPolicy] resources with the `backendRef` field specified.
- Fixed xDS translation failed when oidc tokenEndpoint and jwt remoteJWKS are specified in the same [SecurityPolicy] and using the same hostname.
- Fixed frequent 503 errors when connecting to a Service experiencing high Pod churn.
- Disabled the retry policy for the JWT provider to reduce requests sent to the JWKS endpoint. Failed async fetches will retry every 1s.
- Fixed BackendTLSPolicy not supporting the use of a port name as the `sectionName` in `targetRefs`.
- Fixed reference grant from [EnvoyExtensionPolicy] to the referenced ext-proc backend not being respected.
- Fixed [BackendTrafficPolicy] not applying to Gateway Routes when a Route has a Request Timeout defined.
- Fixed proxies connected to the secondary Envoy Gateway not receiving xDS configuration.
- Fixed traffic splitting not working when some backends were invalid.
- Fixed a nil pointer error that occurred when a [SecurityPolicy] referred to a UDS backend.
- Fixed an issue where the Gateway API translator did not use the TLS configuration from the BackendTLSPolicy when connecting to the OIDC provider‚Äôs well-known endpoint.
- Fixed a validation failure that occurred when multiple HTTPRoutes referred to the same extension filter.
- Fixed a nil pointer error caused by accessing the cookie TTL without verifying if it was valid.
- Fixed unexpected port number shifting in standalone mode.
- Fixed an issue where the shutdown-manager did not respect the security context of the container spec.
- Fixed readiness checks failing for single-stack IPv6 Envoy Gateway deployments on dual-stack clusters.
- Fixed IPv6 dual-stack support not working as intended.
- Fixed the ability to overwrite control plane certs with the certgen command by using a new command arg (-o).
- Fixed a panic that occurred following update to the envoy-gateway-config ConfigMap.
- Fixed prometheus format conversion of ratelimit metrics for remote address.
- Fixed limitations that prevented creation of FQDN Endpoints with a single-character subdomain in [Backend].
- Fixed issue where SecurityContext of shutdown-manager container was not updated by overriding helm values.
- Fixed issue with incorrect IPFamily detection for backends.
- Fixed validation of interval values in Retry settings.

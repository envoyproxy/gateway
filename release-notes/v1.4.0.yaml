new features: |
  Added support for the extension server in standalone mode.
  Added support for the `DynamicResolver` backend type, which can route traffic to any backend service based on the request's hostname.
  Added support for configuring TLS for the `DynamicResolver` backend.
  Added support for optionally installing the Gateway API standard channel CRDs through the `gateway-crds-helm` chart.
  Added support for deploying the Envoy fleet in the Gateway resource namespace. please note that this is currently an experimental feature and not recommended for production use.
  Added support for the offline Kubernetes controller and enabled its use with the file provider.

bug fixes: |
  Allowed the offline Kubernetes controller to use non-default CRDs.
  Fixed an issue when merging a route with multiple parentRefs.
  Fixed the reconciliation logic to continue processing all GatewayClasses even after encountering an error with one.
  Fixed the topology injector blocking the Envoy proxy from starting.
  Increased the shutdown-manager's `failureThreshold` to 10 to ensure Envoy restarts before shutdown-manager in the event of transient network issues.
  Fixed the issue where a `ReferenceGrant` from a `SecurityPolicy` to a referenced `remoteJWKS` backend was not respected.
  Added validation for header values.
  Added validation to prevent duplicated API keys in API Key Auth.
  Fixed `HTTPRoute` precedence by correctly considering header and query match types.
  Ensured the TLS inspector filter is only added to TCP listeners (not UDP/QUIC) when HTTP/3 is enabled via `ClientTrafficPolicy`, preventing nil pointer dereference.

## Envoy Gateway v1.2.0 Release Notes

**Release Date:** November 6, 2024

The Envoy Gateway v1.2.0 release brings a host of new features, performance improvements, and critical bug fixes to enhance networking, traffic management, and security. Explore the latest changes below.

---

## üö® Breaking Changes

- **Gateway API Updates**: Removed `GRPCRoute` and `ReferenceGrant` v1alpha2. [See the Gateway API v1.2.0 documentation](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/releases/tag/v1.2.0) for details.
- **CPU Limits**: Removed default CPU limit for Envoy Gateway deployment to avoid throttling.
- **Envoy Shutdown Settings**: Drain strategy set to immediate, with default values as follows:
  - `minDrainDuration`: 10s
  - `drainTimeout`: 60s
  - `terminationGracePeriodSeconds`: 360s
- **Endpoint Health Removal**: Enabled `ignore_health_on_host_removal` for clusters with static endpoints to improve removal speed.
- **Logging Level Adjustment**: Set xDS and Infra IR logs to Debug level instead of Info, so they will no longer appear in Envoy Gateway logs by default. Change logging level to `debug` to view them.

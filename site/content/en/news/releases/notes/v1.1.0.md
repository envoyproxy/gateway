### Breaking Changes
- SecurityPolicy translation failures will now cause routes referenced by the policy to return an immediate 500 response
- Gateway-API BackendTLSPolicy v1alpha3 is incompatible with previous versions of the CRD
- xPolicy targetRefs can no longer specify a namespace, since Gateway-API v1.1.0 uses LocalPolicyTargetReferenceWithSectionName in Policy resources

### Deprecations
- xPolicy targetRef is deprecated, use targetRefs instead
- SecurityPolicy ExtAuth BackendRef is deprecated, use BackendRefs instead
- OpenTelemetry Proxy Access Log Host and Port are deprecated, use backendRefs instead
- OpenTelemetry Proxy Metrics Sink Host and Port are deprecated, use backendRefs instead
- Proxy Tracing Provider Host and Port are deprecated, use backendRefs instead
- Envoy Gateway Extension Server Host and Port are deprecated, use BackendEndpoint instead

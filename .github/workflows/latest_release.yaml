          This is the "latest" release of **Envoy Gateway**, which contains the most recent commits from the main branch.

          This release **might not be stable**.

          It is only intended for developers wishing to try out the latest features in Envoy Gateway, some of which may not be fully implemented.

          We use `v0.0.0-latest` as the latest chart version to install latest envoy-gateway:

          ```shell
          helm install eg oci://docker.io/envoyproxy/gateway-helm --version v0.0.0-latest -n envoy-gateway-system --create-namespace
          ```

          Try latest version of `egctl` with:

          ```shell
          curl -Ls https://gateway.envoyproxy.io/get-egctl.sh | VERSION=latest bash
          ```

    # Check if latest release and tag are created properly,
    # if not, the workflow needs to report an error,
    # let maintainers be aware of it and rerun it manually.
    # After Recreate the Latest Release and Tag, we need to sleep some time to wait
    # new tag and release are created before checking it.
    - name: Check Latest Release and Tag
      run: |
        sleep 4
        make latest-release-check

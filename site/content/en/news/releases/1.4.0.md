## What's New

Envoy Gateway v1.4.0 introduces powerful new features across traffic management, observability, security, extensibility, and infrastructure ‚Äî along with key stability improvements.

---

## üö® Breaking Changes

- **Envoy Readiness Port**: A dedicated listener port (`19003`) is now used for Envoy proxy readiness.
- **Access Log Format**: The default access log now uses the Envoy JSON formatter instead of the plain text formatter.
- **xDS Snapshot Behavior**: Envoy Gateway now skips xDS snapshot updates if errors occur during xDS translation.
- **Extension Manager Behavior**:
  - With `failOpen: true`, translation errors are logged and suppressed.
  - With `failOpen: false`, xDS updates are skipped for affected resources (no longer replaced).

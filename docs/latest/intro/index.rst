Introduction
============

Envoy Gateway is an open source project for managing Envoy Proxy as a
standalone or Kubernetes-based application gateway. Currently, it uses
Gateway API as its sole configuration language.

Many things are in the scope of Envoy Gateway. Many things are not. Many
things (like support for non-Kubernetes instances) will be in scope later,
but are not now.

.. note::

   This project is under active development. Many, many features are not
   complete. We would love for you to :doc:`get involved<../get_involved>`.

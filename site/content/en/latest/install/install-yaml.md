This task walks you through installing Envoy Gateway in your Kubernetes cluster.

The manual install process does not allow for as much control over configuration
as the [Helm install method](./install-helm), so if you need more control over your Envoy Gateway
installation, it is recommended that you use helm.

Envoy Gateway is typically deployed in a Kubernetes cluster.
If you donâ€™t have one yet, you can use `kind` to create a local cluster for testing purposes.

## Install with YAML

1. In your terminal, run the following command:

    ```shell
    kubectl apply --server-side -f https://github.com/envoyproxy/gateway/releases/download/{{< yaml-version >}}/install.yaml
    ```

2. Next Steps

   Envoy Gateway should now be successfully installed and running, but in order to experience more abilities of Envoy Gateway, you can refer to [Tasks](/latest/tasks).

## Upgrading from v1.2

Some manual migration steps are required to upgrade Envoy Gateway to v1.3.

1. Update Gateway-API and Envoy Gateway CRDs:

```shell
helm pull oci://docker.io/envoyproxy/gateway-helm --version {{< yaml-version >}} --untar
kubectl apply --force-conflicts --server-side -f ./gateway-helm/crds/gatewayapi-crds.yaml
kubectl apply --force-conflicts --server-side -f ./gateway-helm/crds/generated
```

2. Install Envoy Gateway {{< yaml-version >}}:

```shell
helm upgrade eg oci://docker.io/envoyproxy/gateway-helm --version {{< yaml-version >}} -n envoy-gateway-system
```

## Open Ports

## Overview

**Envoy Gateway** is a Kubernetes-native [API Gateway](api-gateways.md) and reverse proxy control plane. It simplifies deploying and operating [Envoy Proxy](proxy.md) as a data plane by using the standard [Gateway API](gateway-api.md) and its own extensible APIs.

By combining Envoy's performance and flexibility with Kubernetes-native configuration, Envoy Gateway helps platform teams expose and manage secure, observable, and scalable APIs with minimal operational overhead.

## Why Use Envoy Gateway?

Traditionally, configuring Envoy Proxy required deep networking expertise and writing complex configuration files. Envoy Gateway removes that barrier by:

- Integrating tightly with Kubernetes through the Gateway API
- Providing custom CRDs for advanced traffic policies
- Automatically translating Kubernetes resources into Envoy config
- Managing the lifecycle of Envoy Proxy instances

Envoy Gateway is designed to be **simple for app developers**, **powerful for platform engineers**, and **production-ready for large-scale deployments**.

## Structure

The different layers of Envoy Gateway are the following:

| Layer       | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **User Configuration** | Users define routing, security, and traffic policies using standard Kubernetes Gateway API resources, optionally extended with Envoy Gateway CRDs.|
| **Envoy Gateway Controller** | A control plane component that watches Gateway API and Envoy Gateway-specific resources, translates them, and produces configuration for Envoy Proxy.|
| **Envoy Proxy(Data Plane)** | A high-performance proxy that receives and handles live traffic according to the configuration generated by Envoy Gateway.|

Together, these layers create a system that's:
- Easy to configure
- Powerful enough for complex needs
- Standardized and familiar
- Ready for the future

## Bug fixes
- Disabled the retry policy for the JWT provider to reduce requests sent to the JWKS endpoint. Failed async fetches will retry every 1s.
- Used a waitGroup instead of an enabled channel in the status updater.

## Other changes
- EG Listens on IPv4 by default, but if IPFamily is set to IPv6 or DualStack, it listens on :: and enables ipv4_compat for DualStack.
- Bumped Gateway API to v1.2.1.

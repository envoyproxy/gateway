# Charter

The Envoy Gateway Steering Committee is the governing body of the Envoy Gateway project,
providing decision-making and oversight pertaining to the Envoy Gateway project bylaws,
sub-organizations, and financial planning. The Steering Committee is composed of end
users and system integrators and will be responsible for the following:

- Technical Direction and roadmap of the project.
- Defining the scope and boundaries of the project

## General Guidelines

Envoy Gateway will be driven by a steering committee which will decide its direction and
governance. In case of any conflict, steering will vote and decide on the direction of
the project, though the goal will be that decisions are made unanimously and voting is
not needed.

## Voting Procedure

In the unlikely circumstance that a vote is required in order to make forward progress,
a majority vote among steering committee members will be used. This implies that any vote
must be a binary decision between two options. In the case of a tie (due to abstention or
future addition of committee seats), the Envoy core proxy maintainer seat will break the
tie with a super vote.

## Steering Committee

The steering committee is a 6-member governing body that makes directional and strategic
decisions for the Envoy gateway project. It will also decide on any changes on its
governance, marketing and future direction. Seats will be tied to organizations and not
individuals and will be valid for 1 year from the start date.

- Envoy core proxy maintainers [Member: Matt Klein]

- VMware [Member: Winnie Kwon; End Date: 5/16/2023]
- Ambassador Labs [Member: Alex Gervais; End Date: 5/16/2023]

- Tencent Holdings Limited [Member: Xunzhuo Liu; End Date: 5/16/2023]

Steering seats will be evaluated once per year and new people/organizations can be nominated
for being added to the steering committee based on contribution to the project or being a
valuable end user. During initial project bootstrap we will also explicitly reevaluate steering
membership after each release; alpha; beta; GA. The existing steering committee will decide
on any changes to the steering committee based on what is best for the project and community.

Organizations can also be removed from the steering committee due to lack of project commitment
on the same yearly basis. This will be determined by a majority vote of the existing committee.
The exception to this is the Envoy core proxy maintainer seat which is a permanent seat.

## Schedule and Cadence

The project will have one steering meeting every month.

- Closed but recorded online meeting every 3rd Monday of the month at 9:30am PT.

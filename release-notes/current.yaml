# Changes that are expected to cause an incompatibility with previous versions, such as deletions or modifications to existing APIs.
breaking changes: |
  The DirectResponse body in HTTPFilter now supports Envoy command operators for dynamic content. Existing configurations including the template syntax (%) will be interpolated.
  The `0s` timeout in SecurityPolicy is now treated as infinite timeout instead of immediate timeout.
  `SamplingFraction` behavior changed from raw fraction to percentage ratio. This will lead to 100x more sampling than before. E.g. `numerator: 100` used to result in 1% sampling rate, now will result in 100% sampling.

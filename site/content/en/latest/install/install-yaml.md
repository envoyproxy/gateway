This task walks you through installing Envoy Gateway in your Kubernetes cluster.

The manual install process does not allow for as much control over configuration
as the [Helm install method](./install-helm), so if you need more control over your Envoy Gateway
installation, it is recommended that you use helm.

## Before you begin

Envoy Gateway is designed to run in Kubernetes for production. The most essential requirements are:

* Kubernetes 1.25 or later
* The `kubectl` command-line tool

## Install with YAML

Envoy Gateway is typically deployed to Kubernetes from the command line. If you don't have Kubernetes, you should use `kind` to create one.

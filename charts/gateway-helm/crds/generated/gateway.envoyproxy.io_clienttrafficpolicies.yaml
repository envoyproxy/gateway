                            New uses of this type are discouraged because of difficulty
                            describing its usage when embedded in APIs. 1. Ignored
                            fields.  It includes many fields which are not generally
                            honored.  For instance, ResourceVersion and FieldPath
                            are both very rarely valid in actual usage. 2. Invalid
                            usage help.  It is impossible to add specific help for
                            individual usage.  In most embedded usages, there are
                            particular restrictions like, \"must refer only to types
                            A and B\" or \"UID not honored\" or \"name must be restricted\".
                            Those cannot be well described when embedded. 3. Inconsistent
                            validation.  Because the usages are different, the validation
                            rules are different by usage, which makes it hard for
                            users to predict what will happen. 4. The fields are both
                            imprecise and overly precise.  Kind is not a precise mapping
                            to a URL. This can produce ambiguity during interpretation
                            and require a REST mapping.  In most cases, the dependency
                            is on the group,resource tuple and the version of the
                            actual struct is irrelevant. 5. We cannot easily change
                            it.  Because this type is embedded in many locations,
                            updates to this type will affect numerous schemas.  Don't
                            make new APIs embed an underspecified API type they do

                            provided and used type that is well-focused on your reference.

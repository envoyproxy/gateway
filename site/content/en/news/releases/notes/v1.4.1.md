## New Features

- Added support for configuring Subject Alternative Names (SANs) for upstream TLS validation via `BackendTLSPolicy.validation.subjectAltNames`.
- Added support for setting ownerreference to infra resources when Gateway Namespace mode is enabled.

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed OverlappingTLSConfig condition for merged Gateways.
- Fixed an issue with shared rules in the rate limit translator when `clientSelector` is not specified.
- Fixed an issue with handling integer values in zone annotations.
- Fixed an issue where routes without WASM in their EnvoyExtensionPolicies returned HTTP 500 responses when WASM cache initialization failed.
- Fixed an issue where UDP listeners were not created in the Envoy proxyâ€™s xDS configuration.
- Fixed broken rate limit merging for `BackendTrafficPolicy` when the Gateway target defines rate limiting but the Route target does not.
- Fixed an issue that preserves ALPN configuration for listeners with overlapping certificates when ALPN is explicitly set in `ClientTrafficPolicy`.
- Replaced static UID with a dynamic UID for the global rate limit Grafana dashboard.

## Other changes

- Fixed backend TLS e2e test.
- Bumped go version to 1.24.3.

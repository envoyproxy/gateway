This task explains how to extend Envoy Gateway using an Extension Server. Envoy Gateway
can be configured to call an external server over gRPC with the xDS configuration _before_ 
it is sent to Envoy Proxy. The external server can modify the provided configuration 
programmatically using any semantics supported by the [xDS][] API.

Using an extension server allows vendors to add xDS configuration that Envoy Gateway itself
doesn't support with a very high level of control over the generated xDS configuration.

**Note:** Modifying the xDS configuration generated by Envoy Gateway may break functionality
configured by native Envoy Gateway means. Like other cases where the xDS configuration
is modified outside of Envoy Gateway's control, this is risky and should be tested thoroughly,
especially when using the same extension server across different Envoy Gateway versions.

## Introduction

One of the Envoy Gateway project goals is to "provide a common foundation for vendors to 
build value-added products without having to re-engineer fundamental interactions". The
Envoy Gateway Extension Server provides a mechanism where Envoy Gateway tracks all provider
resources and then calls a set of hooks that allow the generated xDS configuration to be
modified before it is sent to Envoy Proxy. See the [design documentation][] for full details.

This task sets up an example extension server that adds the Envoy Proxy Basic Authentication
HTTP filter to all the listeners generated by Envoy Gateway. The example extension server 
includes its own CRD which allows defining username/password pairs that will be accepted by
the Envoy Proxy. 

**Note:** Envoy Gateway supports adding Basic Authentication to routes using a [SecurityPolicy][].
See [this task](../security/basic-auth) for the preferred way to configure Basic 
Authentication.


## Quickstart

### Prerequisites

* Follow the steps from the [Quickstart](../quickstart) task to install Envoy Gateway and the example manifest.
  Before proceeding, you should be able to query the example backend using HTTP.

### Build and run the example Extension Server

Build and deploy the example extension server in the `examples/extension-server` folder into the cluster 
running Envoy Gateway.

* Build the extension server image

  **Note:** The provided `Makefile` builds an image with the name `extension-server:latest`. You may need to create
a different tag for it in order to allow Kubernetes to pull it correctly.

  ```shell
  make image
  ```

* Publish the extension server image in your docker repository

  {{< tabpane text=true >}}
  {{% tab header="local kind server" %}}

  ```shell
  kind load docker-image --name envoy-gateway extension-server:latest
  ```

  {{% /tab %}}
  {{% tab header="other Kubernetes server" %}}

  ```shell
  docker tag extension-server:latest $YOUR_DOCKER_REPO
  docker push $YOUR_DOCKER_REPO
  ```

  {{% /tab %}}
  {{< /tabpane >}}

* Deploy the extension server in your cluster

  If you are using your own docker image repository, make sure to update the `values.yaml` with the correct
image name and tag.

  ```shell
  helm install -n envoy-gateway-system extension-server ./examples/extension-server/charts/extension-server
  ```

### Configure Envoy Gateway

* Grant Envoy Gateway's `ServiceAccount` permission to access the extension server's CRD

  ```shell
  kubectl create clusterrole listener-context-example-viewer \
             --verb=get,list,watch  \
             --resource=ListenerContextExample

  kubectl create clusterrolebinding envoy-gateway-listener-context \
             --clusterrole=listener-context-example-viewer \
             --serviceaccount=envoy-gateway-system:envoy-gateway
  ```

* Configure Envoy Gateway to use the Extension Server

  Add the following fragment to Envoy Gateway's [configuration][] file:

  ```yaml
  extensionManager:
    # Envoy Gateway will watch these resource kinds and use them as extension policies
    # which can be attached to Gateway resources.
    policyResources:
    - group: example.extensions.io
      version: v1alpha1
      kind: ListenerContextExample
    hooks:
      # The type of hooks that should be invoked
      xdsTranslator:
        post:
        - HTTPListener
    service:
      # The service that is hosting the extension server
      fqdn: 
        hostname: extension-server.envoy-gateway-system.svc.cluster.local
        port: 5005
  ```

  After updating Envoy Gateway's configuration file, restart Envoy Gateway.

## Testing

Get the Gateway's address:

```shell
export GATEWAY_HOST=$(kubectl get gateway/eg -o jsonpath='{.status.addresses[0].value}')
```

The extension server adds the Basic Authentication HTTP filter to all listeners configured by 
Envoy Gateway. Initially there are no valid user/password combinations available. Accessing the
example backend should fail with a 401 status:

```console
$ curl -v --header "Host: www.example.com" "http://${GATEWAY_HOST}/example"
...
> GET /example HTTP/1.1
> Host: www.example.com
> User-Agent: curl/7.81.0
> Accept: */*
> 
* Mark bundle as not supporting multiuse
< HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
< www-authenticate: Basic realm="http://www.example.com/example"
< content-length: 58
< content-type: text/plain
< date: Mon, 08 Jul 2024 10:53:11 GMT
< 
...
User authentication failed. Missing username and password.
...
```

Add a new Username/Password combination using the example extension server's CRD:

```shell
kubectl apply -f - << EOF 
apiVersion: example.extensions.io/v1alpha1
kind: ListenerContextExample
metadata:
  name: listeneruser
spec:
  targetRefs:
  - kind: Gateway
    name: eg
    group: gateway.networking.k8s.io
  username: user
  password: p@ssw0rd
EOF
```

Authenticating with this user/password combination will now work.

```console
$ curl -v http://${GATEWAY_HOST}/example  -H "Host: www.example.com"   --user 'user:p@ssw0rd'
...
> GET /example HTTP/1.1
> Host: www.example.com
> Authorization: Basic dXNlcm5hbWU6cEBzc3cwcmQ=
> User-Agent: curl/7.81.0
> Accept: */*
> 
* Mark bundle as not supporting multiuse
< HTTP/1.1 200 OK
< content-type: application/json
< x-content-type-options: nosniff
< date: Mon, 08 Jul 2024 10:56:17 GMT

...
 "headers": {

  ],

  ],

```

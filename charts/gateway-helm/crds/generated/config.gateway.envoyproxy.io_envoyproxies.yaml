                  used for the managed Envoy Proxy fleet instead of the default Bootstrap
                  configuration set by Envoy Gateway. Some fields within the Bootstrap
                  that are required to communicate with the xDS Server (Envoy Gateway)
                  and receive xDS resources from it are not configurable and will
                  result in the `EnvoyProxy` resource being rejected. Backward compatibility
                  across minor versions is not guaranteed. We strongly recommend using
                  `egctl x translate` to generate a `EnvoyProxy` resource with the
                  `Bootstrap` field set to the default Bootstrap configuration used.
                  You can edit this configuration, and rerun `egctl x translate` to
                  ensure there are no validation errors.

                              provider supports it). "ClusterIP" means a service will
                              only be accessible inside the cluster, via the cluster
                              IP.

bug fixes: |
  Fixed configured OIDC authorization endpoint being overridden by discovered endpoints from issuer's well-known URL.
  Fix 500 errors caused by partially invalid BackendRefs; traffic is now correctly routed between valid backends and 500 responses according to their configured weights.
  Fixed an issue where BackendTrafficPolicy does not validate maximum value of requestBuffer limit.
  Fixed an issue where observedGeneration is missing from the EnvoyPatchPolicy status.
  Fixed a nil pointer error when applying BackendTrafficPolicy to HTTPRoutes with no backendRefs.
  Fixed ExternalTrafficPolicy not being applied to Envoy Service when ServiceType is NodePort.
  Fixed CRL ref not processed by gateway controller.
  Fixed an issue where HTTP/3 listeners could not handle multiple hostnames.
  Fix gateway continuing with incomplete resources after unrecoverable Kubernetes discovery errors when checking optional CRDs by failing fast and propagating errors so pods restart instead of skipping optional CRDs.
  Fixed an issue where listener translation fails when contains invalid certificate in multiple TLS certificateRefs.
  Fixed an issue where auto-detect upstream protocol breaks with multiple backends(HTTP + HTTPS).
  Fixed wrong cluster type selection when an HTTPRoute mixes Service backends with Backend (FQDN) references, ensuring STRICT_DNS clusters are generated for the FQDN targets.
  Rejected ClientTrafficPolicy if invalid TLS cipher suites are configured.

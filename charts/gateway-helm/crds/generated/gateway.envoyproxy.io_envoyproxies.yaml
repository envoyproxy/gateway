                  set by Envoy Gateway.
                  Some fields within the Bootstrap that are required to communicate with the xDS Server (Envoy Gateway) and receive xDS resources
                  from it are not configurable and will result in the `EnvoyProxy` resource being rejected.
                  Backward compatibility across minor versions is not guaranteed.
                  We strongly recommend using `egctl x translate` to generate a `EnvoyProxy` resource with the `Bootstrap` field set to the default
                  Bootstrap configuration used. You can edit this configuration, and rerun `egctl x translate` to ensure there are no validation errors.

                                      reason (Ready transitions to false, is evicted, or is drained) an updated
                                      pod is immediatedly created on that node without considering surge limits.
                                      Allowing surge implies the possibility that the resources consumed by the
                                      daemonset on any given node can double if the readiness check fails, and
                                      so resource intensive daemonsets should take into account that they may
                                      cause evictions during disruption.

                                      number of DaemonSet pods at the start of the update (ex: 10%). Absolute
                                      number is calculated from percentage by rounding up.

                                      starts by stopping at most 30% of those DaemonSet pods and then brings
                                      up new DaemonSet pods in their place. Once the new pods are available,
                                      it then proceeds onto other DaemonSet pods, thus ensuring that at least

To report a security issue:

    - Potential impact of the vulnerability.
    - Any suggested remediation or patches (if applicable).

We aim to respond to vulnerability reports within **48 hours** and will work with you to validate and address the issue. 
Once a resolution is identified, we will coordinate a release timeline with you and provide credit if applicable (with your consent).

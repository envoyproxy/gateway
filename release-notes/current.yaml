# Changes that are expected to cause an incompatibility with previous versions, such as deletions or modifications to existing APIs.
breaking changes: |
  Use a dedicated listener port(19003) for envoy proxy readiness
  Uses the envoy JSON formatter for the default access log instead of text formatter.
  Envoy Gateway would skip xDS snapshot updates in case of errors during xDS translation.
  When Extension Manager is configured to Fail Open, translation errors are logged and suppressed.
  When Extension Manager is configured to not Fail Open, EG will no longer replace affected resources. Instead, xDS snapshot update would be skipped.

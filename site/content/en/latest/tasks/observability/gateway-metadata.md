title: "Gateway API Metadata"
---

## Background 
Envoy Gateway translates Gateway API resources to Envoy XDS resources. In this translation process, Envoy Gateway annotates XDS resources with additional metadata from their origin Gateway API resources. 

Gateway API Metadata includes:
- K8s Resource Names and Namespaces.
- K8s Resource Annotations with the `gateway.envoyproxy.io/` prefix.
- K8s Resource SectionNames (when applicable, e.g. for Route rules and Listeners).

Gateway API Metadata is added to XDS resources using envoy's [Static Metadata][] in relevant XDS resources. Gateway API Metadata includes a list of origin resources which are added to the `envoy-gateway` namespace. 

For example, consider the following Gateway API HTTPRoute:

```yaml
kind: HTTPRoute
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  annotations:
    gateway.envoyproxy.io/foo: bar
  name: myroute
  namespace: myns
spec:
  rules:
  - name: myrule
    matches:
    - path:
        type: PathPrefix
        value: /mypath
```

The translated to an XDS [Route][] contains Gateway API metadata under `metadata.filter_metadata.envoy-gateway.resources`: 

```yaml
name: httproute/myns/myroute/rule/0/match/0/*
match:
  path_separated_prefix: "/mypath"
route:
  cluster: httproute/myns/myroute/rule/0
metadata:
  filter_metadata:
    envoy-gateway:
      resources:
      - namespace: myns
        kind: HTTPRoute
        annotations:
          foo: bar
        name: myroute
        sectionName: myrule
```

## Supported Resources 
Currently, the following Gateway API metadata is generated by Envoy Gateway:
- [Virtual Host][] metadata is derived from the Gateway resources and includes: Gateway Metadata and Listener Name as SectionName.
- [Route][] metadata is derived from the HTTPRoute/GRPCRoute resource and includes: xRoute Metadata and Route Rule Name as SectionName.
- [Cluster][] metadata is derived from one of:
  - All xRoute resources and includes: xRoute Metadata and Route Rule Name as SectionName.
  - EnvoyProxy, EnvoyExtensionPolicy or SecurityPolicy and includes resource metadata, when such resources include a backendRef. 
- [LBEndpoints][] metadata is derived from the Service, ServiceImport or Backend resources and includes: Resource Metadata and backendRef Port as SectionName.

## Use Cases
XDS Metadata serves multiple purposes:
- Observability: Envoy proxy access logs can be [enriched with Gateway-API resource](./proxy-accesslog.md) context and custom annotations, creating an association with relevant Application Developers personas.
- Troubleshooting: users and tools that analyze the envoy proxy XDS config can identify the Gateway API resources that lead to the XDS configuration's creation.
- Extensibility: 
  - Envoy Gateway [Extension Servers][] can leverage Gateway API metadata as additional context annotating XDS resources sent for mutation.  
  - Envoy Proxy extensions can leverage XDS metadata as additional context when processing traffic:
    - [lua][] extensions can access metadata using the [Metadata Stream handle API][] .
    - [ext_proc][] extensions can access metadata using the `xds.*_metadata` [ext_proc attribute][].

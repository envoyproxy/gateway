              APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object.
              Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and
              may reject unrecognized values.

                    LocalPolicyTargetReferenceWithSectionName identifies an API object to apply a
                    direct policy to. This should be used as part of Policy resources that can
                    target single resources. For more information on how this policy attachment
                    mode works, and a sample Policy resource, refer to the policy attachment
                    documentation for Gateway API.


                    Note: This should only be used for direct policy attachment when references
                    to SectionName are actually needed. In all other cases,
                    LocalPolicyTargetReference should be used.

                      description: |-
                        SectionName is the name of a section within the target resource. When
                        unspecified, this targetRef targets the entire resource. In the following
                        resources, SectionName is interpreted as the following:


                        * Gateway: Listener name
                        * HTTPRoute: HTTPRouteRule name
                        * Service: Port name


                        If a SectionName is specified, but does not exist on the targeted object,
                        the Policy must fail to attach, and the policy implementation should record
                        a `ResolvedRefs` or similar Condition in the Policy's status.

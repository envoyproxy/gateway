Some fields within the Bootstrap that are required to communicate with the xDS Server (Envoy Gateway) and receive xDS resources from it are not configurable and will result in the `EnvoyProxy` resource being rejected. Backward compatibility across minor versions is not guaranteed. We strongly recommend using `egctl x translate` to generate a `EnvoyProxy` resource with the `Bootstrap` field set to the default Bootstrap configuration used. You can edit this configuration, and rerun `egctl x translate` to ensure there are no validation errors. |

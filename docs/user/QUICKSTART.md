## Introduction
This guide will help you get started with Envoy Gateway in a few simple steps.

## Prerequisites
A Kubernetes cluster.

__Note:__ Envoy Gateway is tested against Kubernetes v1.24.0.

## Installation
Install the Gateway API CRDs:
```shell
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/envoyproxy/gateway/releases/download/v0.2.0-rc2/gatewayapi-crds.yaml
```

Run Envoy Gateway:
```shell
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/envoyproxy/gateway/releases/download/v0.2.0-rc2/install.yaml
```

Run the example app:
```shell
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/envoyproxy/gateway/v0.2.0-rc2/examples/kubernetes/httpbin.yaml
```

The Gateway API resources must be created in the following order. First, create the GatewayClass:
```shell
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/envoyproxy/gateway/v0.2.0-rc2/examples/kubernetes/gatewayclass.yaml
```

Create the Gateway:
```shell
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com//envoyproxy/gateway/v0.2.0-rc2/examples/kubernetes/gateway.yaml
```

Create the HTTPRoute to route traffic through Envoy proxy to the example app:
```shell
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/envoyproxy/gateway/v0.2.0-rc2/examples/kubernetes/httproute.yaml
```

### Testing the configuration
Port forward to the Envoy service:
```shell
kubectl -n envoy-gateway-system port-forward service/envoy-default-eg 8888:8080 &
```

Curl the example app through Envoy proxy:
```shell
curl --verbose --header "Host: www.example.com" http://localhost:8888/get
```
You can replace `get` with any of the supported [httpbin methods][httpbin_methods].

### For clusters with External Loadbalancer support
You can also test the same functionality by sending traffic to the External IP. To get the external IP of the
Envoy service, run:
```shell
export GATEWAY_HOST=$(kubectl get svc/envoy-default-eg -n envoy-gateway-system -o jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}')
```

In certain environments, the load balancer may be exposed using a hostname, instead of an IP address. If so, replace
`ip` in the above command with `hostname`.

Curl the example app through Envoy proxy:
```shell
curl --verbose --header "Host: www.example.com" http://$GATEWAY_HOST:8080/get
```
You can replace `get` with any of the supported [httpbin methods][httpbin_methods].

## Clean-Up
Use the steps in this section to uninstall everything from the quickstart guide.

Delete the HTTPRoute:
```shell
kubectl delete httproute/httpbin
```

Delete the Gateway:
```shell
kubectl delete gateway/eg
```

Delete the GatewayClass:
```shell
kubectl delete gc/eg
```

Uninstall the example app:
```shell
kubectl delete -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/envoyproxy/gateway/v0.2.0-rc2/examples/kubernetes/httpbin.yaml
```

Uninstall Envoy Gateway:
```shell
kubectl delete -f https://github.com/envoyproxy/gateway/releases/download/v0.2.0-rc2/install.yaml
```

Uninstall Gateway API CRDs:
```shell
kubectl delete -f https://github.com/envoyproxy/gateway/releases/download/v0.2.0-rc2/gatewayapi-crds.yaml
```

# Changes that are expected to cause an incompatibility with previous versions, such as deletions or modifications to existing APIs.
breaking changes: |
  ALPNProtocols in EnvoyProxy Backend TLS setting use [h2, http/1.1] if not set.
  When a Backend resource specifies TLS settings and SNI is not specified or a BackendTLSPolicy is not attached to it, the value of upstream TLS SNI is determined by the HTTP Host header.
  When a Backend resource specifies TLS settings and SNI is not specified or a BackendTLSPolicy is not attached to it, the upstream certificate is validated for DNS SAN matching the SNI value sent.
  When a MirrorPolicy is used, the shadow host suffix is not appended to the mirrored cluster name.
  When running `egctl experimental collect`, SDS will not be dumped, you can enable it by adding `--sds true`.
  When setting the 'consecutiveGatewayFailure' will 'enforcingConsecutiveGatewayFailure set to 100.

# New features or capabilities added in this release.
new features: |
  Added support for mTLS configuration for ExtensionServer.
  Added support for RetryPolicy in gRPC ExtAuth callouts via SecurityPolicy backend settings fields.
  Added support for late response headers in ClientTrafficPolicy.
  Added max connection/stream duration and max requests per connection to ClientTrafficPolicy.
  Added PercentageEnabled to ZoneAware lb config.
  Added cacheDuration for remoteJWKS in SecurityPolicy.
  Added support for DisableTokenEncryption in OIDC authn to disable encryption of ID and access tokens stored in cookies.
  Added support for OCSP stapling in the listener TLS certificates.
  Added support for per-backend client TLS settings in Backend resources. This allows configuring the client certificate as well as TLS protocol parameters such as ciphers, TLS versions, and ALPN protocols on a per-backend basis.
  Added support for returning 503 responses when no valid backend endpoints exist.
  Added support for CSRFTokenTTL in OIDC authn to configure the lifetime of the CSRF token used during the OAuth2 authorization code flow.
  Added support for http2 stream timeout
  Added support for Envoy PreconnectPolicy in BackendTrafficPolicy.
  Added support for binaryData in ConfigMap referenced by HTTPRouteFilter for direct response.
  Added support PDB for Ratelimit service.
  Added support for allowing OPTIONS method implicitly when HTTPRoute CORS filter is used.
  Added support rate limit based on path and method in BackendTrafficPolicy.

bug fixes: |
  Fixed %ROUTE_KIND% operator to be lower-cased when used by clusterStatName in EnvoyProxy API.
  Fixed maxAcceptPerSocketEvent being ignored in ClientTrafficPolicy.
  Fixed the topologyInjectorDisabled and the local cluster was not defined.
  Fixed log formatting of improper key-value pairs to avoid DPANIC in controller-runtime logger.
  Fixed handling of context-related transient errors to prevent incorrect state reconciliation and unintended behavior.
  Fixed the controller cannot read the EnvoyProxy attached gatewayclass only.
  Fixed adding metadata for proxyService and oidc xds clusters.
  Fixed handling of millisecond-level retry durations and token TTLs in OIDC authn.
  Fixed indexer and controller crashing when BackendTrafficPolicy has a redirect response override.
  Fixed Lua validator log level to be suppressed by default.
  Fixed ProxyTopologyInjector cache sync race condition that caused injection failures
  Fixed validation for grpc routes with extension ref filters.
  Fixed service account token handling in GatewayNamespaceMode to use SDS for properly refreshing expired token.
  Fixed handling of regex meta characters in prefix match replace for URL rewrite.
  Disabled the default emission of `x-envoy-ratelimited` headers from the rate limit filter; re-enable with the `enableEnvoyHeaders` setting in ClientTrafficPolicy.
  Fixed a nil pointer panic in the XDS translator when building API key authentication filter configurations with `sanitize` enabled and no `forwardClientIDHeader` set.
  Truncated Gateway API status condition messages to stay within Kubernetes limits and prevent update failures.
  Fixed an issue in EnvoyPatchPolicy where it didn't match the target Gateway/GatewayClass due to an incorrect name reference.
  Fixed certificate SAN overlap detection in gateway listeners.
  Fixed description and translation behavior for PreserveXRequestID

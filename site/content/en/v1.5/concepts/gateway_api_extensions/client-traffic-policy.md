## Overview

`ClientTrafficPolicy` is an extension to the Kubernetes Gateway API that allows system administrators to configure how the Envoy Proxy server behaves with downstream clients. It is a policy attachment resource that can be applied to Gateway resources and holds settings for configuring the behavior of the connection between the downstream client and Envoy Proxy listener.

Think of `ClientTrafficPolicy` as a set of rules for your Gateway's entry points, it lets you configure specific behaviors for each listener in your Gateway, with more specific rules taking precedence over general ones.

## Use Cases

`ClientTrafficPolicy` is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to:

1. **Enforce TLS Security**
   Configure TLS termination, mutual TLS (mTLS), and certificate validation at the edge.

2. **Manage Client Connections**
   Control TCP keepalive behavior and connection timeouts for optimal resource usage.

3. **Handle Client Identity**
   Configure trusted proxy chains to correctly resolve client IPs for logging and access control.

4. **Normalize Request Paths**
   Sanitize incoming request paths to ensure compatibility with backend routing rules.

5. **Tune HTTP Protocols**
   Configure HTTP/1, HTTP/2, and HTTP/3 settings for compatibility and performance.

6. **Monitor Listener Health**
   Set up health checks for integration with load balancers and failover mechanisms.

## ClientTrafficPolicy in Envoy Gateway

`ClientTrafficPolicy` is part of the Envoy Gateway API suite, which extends the Kubernetes Gateway API with additional capabilities. It's implemented as a Custom Resource Definition (CRD) that you can use to configure how Envoy Gateway manages incoming client traffic.

### Targets

ClientTrafficPolicy can be attached to Gateway API resources using two targeting mechanisms:

1. **Direct Reference (`targetRefs`)**: Explicitly reference specific Gateway resources by name and kind.
2. **Label Selection (`targetSelectors`)**: Match Gateway resources based on their labels (see [targetSelectors API reference](../../api/extension_types#targetselectors))

The policy applies to all Gateway resources that match either targeting method.

**Important**: A ClientTrafficPolicy can only target Gateway resources in the same namespace as the policy itself.

### Precedence

When multiple ClientTrafficPolicies apply to the same resource, Envoy Gateway resolves conflicts using section-level specificity and creation-time priority:

1. **Section-specific policies** (targeting specific listeners via `sectionName`) - Highest precedence
2. **Gateway-wide policies** (targeting entire Gateway) - Lower precedence

#### Multiple Policies at the Same Level

When multiple ClientTrafficPolicies target the same resource at the same specificity level (e.g., multiple policies targeting the same Gateway listener section), Envoy Gateway uses the following tie-breaking rules:

1. **Creation Time Priority**: The oldest policy (earliest `creationTimestamp`) takes precedence
2. **Name-based Sorting**: If policies have identical creation timestamps, they are sorted alphabetically by namespaced name, with the first policy taking precedence

```yaml
# Policy created first - takes precedence
apiVersion: gateway.envoyproxy.io/v1alpha1
kind: ClientTrafficPolicy
metadata:
  name: alpha-policy
  creationTimestamp: "2023-01-01T10:00:00Z"
spec:
  targetRefs:
    - kind: Gateway
      name: my-gateway
      sectionName: https-listener
  timeout:
    http:
      idleTimeout: 30s

---
# Policy created later - lower precedence
apiVersion: gateway.envoyproxy.io/v1alpha1
kind: ClientTrafficPolicy
metadata:
  name: beta-policy
  creationTimestamp: "2023-01-01T11:00:00Z"
spec:
  targetRefs:
    - kind: Gateway
      name: my-gateway
      sectionName: https-listener
  timeout:
    http:
      idleTimeout: 40s
```

In this example, `alpha-policy` would take precedence due to its earlier creation time, so the listener would use `idleTimeout: 30s`.

For example, consider these policies with different specificity levels targeting the same Gateway:

```yaml
# Policy A: Targets a specific listener in the gateway
apiVersion: gateway.envoyproxy.io/v1alpha1
kind: ClientTrafficPolicy
metadata:
  name: listener-specific-policy
spec:
  targetRefs:
    - kind: Gateway
      name: my-gateway
      sectionName: https-listener  # Targets specific listener
  timeout:
    http:
      idleTimeout: 30s

---
# Policy B: Targets the entire gateway
apiVersion: gateway.envoyproxy.io/v1alpha1
kind: ClientTrafficPolicy
metadata:
  name: gateway-wide-policy
spec:
  targetRefs:
    - kind: Gateway
      name: my-gateway  # Targets all listeners
  timeout:
    http:
      idleTimeout: 60s
```

In this case:
- Policy A will be applied/attached to the specific Listener defined in the `targetRef.SectionName`
- Policy B will be applied to the remaining Listeners within the Gateway. Policy B will have an additional status condition Overridden=True.

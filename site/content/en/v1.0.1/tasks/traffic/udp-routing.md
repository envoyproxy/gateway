title: "UDP Routing"
---

The [UDPRoute][] resource allows users to configure UDP routing by matching UDP traffic and forwarding it to Kubernetes
backends. This task will use CoreDNS example to walk you through the steps required to configure UDPRoute on Envoy
Gateway.

__Note:__ UDPRoute allows Envoy Gateway to operate as a non-transparent proxy between a UDP client and server. The lack
of transparency means that the upstream server will see the source IP and port of the Gateway instead of the client.
For additional information, refer to Envoy's [UDP proxy documentation][].

## Prerequisites

Follow the steps from the [Quickstart](../../quickstart) to install Envoy Gateway and the example manifest.
Before proceeding, you should be able to query the example backend using HTTP.

## Installation

Install CoreDNS in the Kubernetes cluster as the example backend. The installed CoreDNS is listening on
UDP port 53 for DNS lookups.

```shell
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/envoyproxy/gateway/latest/examples/kubernetes/udp-routing-example-backend.yaml
```

Wait for the CoreDNS deployment to become available:

```shell
kubectl wait --timeout=5m deployment/coredns --for=condition=Available
```

Update the Gateway from the Quickstart to include a UDP listener that listens on UDP port `5300`:

```shell
kubectl patch gateway eg --type=json --patch '
  - op: add
    path: /spec/listeners/-
    value:
      name: coredns
      protocol: UDP
      port: 5300
      allowedRoutes:
        kinds:
        - kind: UDPRoute
  '
```

Verify the Gateway status:

```shell
kubectl get gateway/eg -o yaml
```

## Configuration

Create a UDPRoute resource to route UDP traffic received on Gateway port 5300 to the CoredDNS backend.

```shell
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1alpha2
kind: UDPRoute
metadata:
  name: coredns
spec:
  parentRefs:
    - name: eg
      sectionName: coredns
  rules:
    - backendRefs:
        - name: coredns
          port: 53
EOF
```

Verify the UDPRoute status:

```shell
kubectl get udproute/coredns -o yaml
```

## Testing

Get the External IP of the Gateway:

```shell
export GATEWAY_HOST=$(kubectl get gateway/eg -o jsonpath='{.status.addresses[0].value}')
```

Use `dig` command to query the dns entry foo.bar.com through the Gateway.

```shell
dig @${GATEWAY_HOST} -p 5300 foo.bar.com
```

You should see the result of the dns query as the below output, which means that the dns query has been successfully
routed to the backend CoreDNS.

Note: 49.51.177.138 is the resolved address of GATEWAY_HOST.

```bash
; <<>> DiG 9.18.1-1ubuntu1.1-Ubuntu <<>> @49.51.177.138 -p 5300 foo.bar.com

## Clean-Up

Follow the steps from the [Quickstart](../../quickstart) to uninstall Envoy Gateway.

Delete the CoreDNS example manifest and the UDPRoute:

```shell
kubectl delete deploy/coredns
kubectl delete service/coredns
kubectl delete cm/coredns
kubectl delete udproute/coredns
```

This "quick start" will help you get started with Envoy Gateway in a few simple steps.

## Prerequisites

A Kubernetes cluster.

__Note:__ Refer to the [Compatibility Matrix](../install/matrix) for supported Kubernetes versions.

__Note:__ In case your Kubernetes cluster, does not have a LoadBalancer implementation, we recommend installing one
so the `Gateway` resource has an Address associated with it. We recommend using [MetalLB](https://metallb.universe.tf/installation/).

## Installation

Install the Gateway API CRDs and Envoy Gateway:

```shell
helm install eg oci://docker.io/envoyproxy/gateway-helm --version v0.0.0-latest -n envoy-gateway-system --create-namespace
```

Wait for Envoy Gateway to become available:

```shell
kubectl wait --timeout=5m -n envoy-gateway-system deployment/envoy-gateway --for=condition=Available
```

Install the GatewayClass, Gateway, HTTPRoute and example app:

```shell
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/envoyproxy/gateway/releases/download/latest/quickstart.yaml -n default
```

**Note**: [`quickstart.yaml`] defines that Envoy Gateway will listen for
traffic on port 80 on its globally-routable IP address, to make it easy to use
browsers to test Envoy Gateway. When Envoy Gateway sees that its Listener is
using a privileged port (<1024), it will map this internally to an
unprivileged port, so that Envoy Gateway doesn't need additional privileges.
It's important to be aware of this mapping, since you may need to take it into
consideration when debugging.

[`quickstart.yaml`]: https://github.com/envoyproxy/gateway/releases/download/latest/quickstart.yaml

## Testing the Configuration

{{< tabpane text=true >}}
{{% tab header="With External LoadBalancer Support" %}}

You can also test the same functionality by sending traffic to the External IP. To get the external IP of the
Envoy service, run:

```shell
export GATEWAY_HOST=$(kubectl get gateway/eg -o jsonpath='{.status.addresses[0].value}')
```

In certain environments, the load balancer may be exposed using a hostname, instead of an IP address. If so, replace
`ip` in the above command with `hostname`.

Curl the example app through Envoy proxy:

```shell
curl --verbose --header "Host: www.example.com" http://$GATEWAY_HOST/get
```

{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab header="Without LoadBalancer Support" %}}

Get the name of the Envoy service created the by the example Gateway:

```shell
export ENVOY_SERVICE=$(kubectl get svc -n envoy-gateway-system --selector=gateway.envoyproxy.io/owning-gateway-namespace=default,gateway.envoyproxy.io/owning-gateway-name=eg -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}')
```

Port forward to the Envoy service:

```shell
kubectl -n envoy-gateway-system port-forward service/${ENVOY_SERVICE} 8888:80 &
```

Curl the example app through Envoy proxy:

```shell
curl --verbose --header "Host: www.example.com" http://localhost:8888/get
```

## What to explore next?

In this quickstart, you have:
- Installed Envoy Gateway
- Deployed a backend service, and a gateway
- Configured the gateway using Kubernetes Gateway API resources [Gateway](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/api-types/gateway/) and [HttpRoute](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/api-types/httproute/) to direct incoming requests over HTTP to the backend service.

Here is a suggested list of follow-on tasks to guide you in your exploration of Envoy Gateway:

- [HTTP Routing](traffic/http-routing)
- [Traffic Splitting](traffic/http-traffic-splitting)
- [Secure Gateways](security/secure-gateways/)
- [Global Rate Limit](traffic/global-rate-limit/)
- [gRPC Routing](traffic/grpc-routing/)

Review the [Tasks](./) section for the scenario matching your use case.  The Envoy Gateway tasks are organized by category: traffic management, security, extensibility, observability, and operations.

## Clean-Up

Use the steps in this section to uninstall everything from the quickstart.

Delete the GatewayClass, Gateway, HTTPRoute and Example App:

```shell
kubectl delete -f https://github.com/envoyproxy/gateway/releases/download/latest/quickstart.yaml --ignore-not-found=true
```

Delete the Gateway API CRDs and Envoy Gateway:

```shell
helm uninstall eg -n envoy-gateway-system
```

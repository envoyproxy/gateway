## New Features

- Added support for configuring Subject Alternative Names (SANs) for upstream TLS validation via `BackendTLSPolicy.validation.subjectAltNames`.
- Added support for GatewayInfrastructure in gateway namespace mode.

## Bug Fixes

- Handle integer zone annotation values
- Fixed issue where WASM cache init failure caused routes with WASM-less EnvoyExtensionPolicies to have 500 direct responses.
- Fixed issue which UDP listeners were not created in the Envoy proxy config when Gateway was created.
- Keep ALPN configuration for listeners with overlapping certificates when ALPN is explicitly set in ClientTrafficPolicy.

## System Design

### Goals
* Define the system components needed to satisfy the requirements of Envoy Gateway.

### Non-Goals
* Create a detailed design and interface specification for each system component.

### Terminology
* Control Plane- A collection of inter-related software components for providing application gateway and routing
  functionality. The control plane is implemented by Envoy Gateway and provides services for managing the data plane.
  These services are detailed in the [components](#components) section.
* Data Plane- Provides intelligent application-level traffic routing and is implemented as one or more Envoy proxies.

### Architecture
![Architecture](../images/architecture.png)

### Configuration
Envoy Gateway is configured statically at startup and the managed data plane is configured dynamically through
Kubernetes resources, primarily [Gateway API][gw_api] objects.

#### Static Configuration
Static configuration is used to configure Envoy Gateway at startup, i.e. change the GatewayClass controllerName,
configure a Provider, etc. Currently, Envoy Gateway only supports configuration through a configuration file. If the
configuration file is not provided, Envoy Gateway will start up with default configuration parameters.

#### Dynamic Configuration
Dynamic configuration is based on the concept of a declaring the desired state of the data plane and using
reconciliation loops to drive the actual state toward the desired state. The desired state of the data plane is
defined as Kubernetes resources that provide the following services:
* Infrastructure Management- Manage the data plane infrastructure, i.e. deploy, upgrade, etc. This configuration is
  expressed through [GatewayClass][gc] and [Gateway][gw] resources. A TBD [Custom Resource][cr] can be referenced by
  `gatewayclass.spec.parametersRef` to modify data plane infrastructure default parameters,
  e.g. expose Envoy network endpoints using a NodePort service instead of a LoadBalancer service.
* Traffic Routing- Define how to handle application-level requests to backend services. For example, route all HTTP
  requests for "www.example.com" to a backend service running a web server. This configuration is expressed through
  [HTTPRoute][hroute] and [TLSRoute][troute] resources that match, filter, and route traffic to a [backend][be].
  Although a backend can be any valid Kubernetes Group/Kind resource, Envoy Gateway only supports a [Service][svc]
  reference.

### Components

#### Provider
A Provider is an infrastructure component that Envoy Gateway calls to establish its runtime configuration, resolve
services, persist data, etc. Kubernetes and File are the only supported providers. However, other providers can be added
in the future as Envoy Gateway use cases are better understood. A provider is configured at start up through Envoy
Gateway's [static configuration](#static-configuration).

##### Kubernetes Provider
* Uses Kubernetes-style controllers to reconcile Kubernetes resources that comprise the
  [dynamic configuration](#dynamic-configuration).
* Manages the data plane through Kubernetes API CRUD operations.
* Uses Kubernetes for Service discovery.
* Uses etcd (via Kubernetes API) to persist data.

##### File Provider

* Uses a file watcher to watch files in a directory that define the data plane configuration.
* Manages the data plane by calling internal APIs, e.g. `CreateDataPlane()`.
* Uses the host's DNS for Service discovery.
* If needed, the local filesystem is used to persist data.

#### Resource Watcher
The Resource Watcher watches resources used to establish and maintain Envoy Gateway's dynamic configuration. The
mechanics for watching resources is provider-specific, e.g. informers, caches, etc. are used for the Kubernetes
provider. The Resource Watcher uses the configured provider for input and provides resources to the Resource Translator
as output.

#### Resource Translator
The Resource Translator translates external resources, e.g. GatewayClass, from the Resource Watcher to the Intermediate
Representation (IR). It is responsible for:
* Translating infrastructure-specific resources/fields from the Resource Watcher to the Infra IR.
* Translating proxy configuration resources/fields from the Resource Watcher to the xDS IR.

#### Intermediate Representation (IR)
The Intermediate Representation defines internal data models that external resources are translated into. This allows
Envoy Gateway to be decoupled from the external resources used for dynamic configuration. The IR consists of an Infra IR
used as input for the Infra Manager and an xDS IR used as input for the xDS Translator.
* Infra IR- Used as the internal definition of the managed data plane infrastructure.
* xDS IR- Used as the internal definition of the managed data plane xDS configuration.

#### Config Manager
This component consumes the [Bootstrap Config](#bootstrap-config), and spawns the appropriate internal services in Envoy Gateway based on the config specification.
For e.g. if the platform field in the Bootstrap Config is set to `kubernetes`, the Config Manager will instantiate kubernetes controller services that implement the
[Config Source](#config-source), [Service Resolver](#service-resolver) and the [Envoy Provisioner](#provisioner) interfaces.

#### Message Service
This component allows internal services to publish messages as well as subscribe to them. The message service's interface is used by the [Config Manager](#config-manager) to 
allow communication between the services instantiated by it.
A message bus architecture allows components to be loosely coupled, work in an asynchronous manner and also scale out into multiple processes if needed. 
For e.g. the [Config Source](#config-source) and the [Provisioner](#provisoner) could run as separate processes in different environments decoupling user configuration consumption
from the environment where the Envoy Proxy infrastructure is being provisioned.

#### Service Resolver
This optional component preprocesses the IR resources and resolves the services into endpoints enabling precise load balancing and resilience policies.
For e.g. in Kubernetes, a controller service could watch for EndpointSlice resources, converting Services to Endpoints, allowing for Envoyproxy to skip kube-proxyâ€™s
load balancing layer. This component is tied to the platform where it is running.  When disabled, the services will be resolved by the underlying DNS resolver or
by explicitly specifying IPs.

#### Gateway API Translator
This is a platform agnostic translator that translates Gateway API resources to an Intermediate Representation.

#### xDS Translator
The xDS Translator translates the xDS IR into xDS Resources that are consumed by the xDS server.

#### xDS Server
The xDS Server is a xDS gRPC Server based on [Go Control Plane][go_cp]. Go Control Plane implements the xDS Server
Protocol and is responsible for using xDS to configure the data plane.

#### Infra Manager
The Infra Manager is a provider-specific component responsible for managing the following infrastructure:

* Data Plane - Manages all the infrastructure required to run the managed Envoy proxies. For example, CRUD Deployment,
  Service, etc. resources to run Envoy in a Kubernetes cluster.
* Auxiliary Control Planes - Optional infrastructure needed to implement application Gateway features that require
  external integrations with the managed Envoy proxies. For example, [Global Rate Limiting][grl] requires provisioning
  and configuring the [Envoy Rate Limit Service][rls] and the [Rate Limit filter][rlf]. Such features are exposed to
  users through the [Custom Route Filters][crf] extension.

The Infra Manager consumes the Infra IR as input to manage the data plane infrastructure.

### Design Decisions
* Envoy Gateway will consume one [GatewayClass][gc] by comparing its configured controller name with
  `spec.controllerName` of a GatewayClass. If multiple GatewayClasses exist with the same `spec.controllerName`, Envoy
  Gateway will follow Gateway API [guidelines][gwapi_conflicts] to resolve the conflict.
  `gatewayclass.spec.parametersRef` refers to a custom resource for configuring the managed proxy infrastructure. If
  unspecified, default configuration parameters are used for the managed proxy infrastructure.
* Envoy Gateway will manage [Gateways][gw] that reference its GatewayClass.
  * The first Gateway causes Envoy Gateway to provision the managed Envoy proxy infrastructure.
  * Envoy Gateway will merge multiple Gateways that match its GatewayClass and will follow Gateway API
    [guidelines][gwapi_conflicts] to resolve any conflicts.
  * A Gateway `listener` corresponds to a proxy [Listener][listener].
* An [HTTPRoute][hroute] resource corresponds to a proxy [Route][route].
  * Each [backendRef][be_ref] corresponds to a proxy [Cluster][cluster].
* The goal is to make the Infra Manager & Translator components extensible in the future. For now, extensibility can be
  achieved using xDS support that Envoy Gateway will provide.

The draft for this document is [here][draft_design].

### Caveats
* The custom resource used to configure the data plane infrastructure is TBD. Track [issue 95][issue_95] for the latest
  updates.
* Envoy Gateway's static configuration spec is currently undefined. Track [issue 95][issue_95] for the latest updates.

# Changes that are expected to cause an incompatibility with previous versions, such as deletions or modifications to existing APIs.
breaking changes: |
  ALPNProtocols in EnvoyProxy Backend TLS setting use [h2, http/1.1] if not set.
  When a Backend resource specifies TLS settings and SNI is not specified or a BackendTLSPolicy is not attached to it, the value of upstream TLS SNI is determined by the HTTP Host header.
  When a Backend resource specifies TLS settings and SNI is not specified or a BackendTLSPolicy is not attached to it, the upstream certificate is validated for DNS SAN matching the SNI value sent.

bug fixes: |
  Fixed %ROUTE_KIND% operator to be lower-cased when used by clusterStatName in EnvoyProxy API.
  Fixed maxAcceptPerSocketEvent being ignored in ClientTrafficPolicy.
  Fixed the topologyInjectorDisabled and the local cluster was not defined.
  Fixed log formatting of improper key-value pairs to avoid DPANIC in controller-runtime logger.
  Fixed handling of context-related transient errors to prevent incorrect state reconciliation and unintended behavior.
  Fixed the controller cannot read the EnvoyProxy attached gatewayclass only.
  Fixed adding metadata for proxyService and oidc xds clusters.
  Fixed handling of millisecond-level retry durations and token TTLs in OIDC authn.
  Fixed indexer and controller crashing when BackendTrafficPolicy has a redirect response override.
  Fixed Lua validator log level to be suppressed by default.
  Fixed ProxyTopologyInjector cache sync race condition that caused injection failures
  Fixed validation for grpc routes with extension ref filters.
  Fixed service account token handling in GatewayNamespaceMode to use SDS for properly refreshing expired token.
  Fixed handling of regex meta characters in prefix match replace for URL rewrite.
  Disabled the default emission of `x-envoy-ratelimited` headers from the rate limit filter; re-enable with the `enableEnvoyHeaders` setting in ClientTrafficPolicy.
  Fixed a nil pointer panic in the XDS translator when building API key authentication filter configurations with `sanitize` enabled and no `forwardClientIDHeader` set.
  Truncated Gateway API status condition messages to stay within Kubernetes limits and prevent update failures.
  Fixed an issue in EnvoyPatchPolicy where it didn't match the target Gateway/GatewayClass due to an incorrect name reference.
  Fixed certificate SAN overlap detection in gateway listeners.

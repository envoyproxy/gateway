## New Features

- Added support for the extension server in standalone mode.
- Added support for the `DynamicResolver` backend type, which can route traffic to any backend service based on the request's hostname.
- Added support for configuring TLS for the `DynamicResolver` backend.
- Added support for optionally installing the Gateway API standard channel CRDs through the `gateway-crds-helm` chart.
- Added support for deploying the Envoy fleet in the Gateway resource namespace. please note that this is currently an experimental feature and not recommended for production use.
- Added support for the offline Kubernetes controller and enabled its use with the file provider.

## Bug Fixes

- Allowed the offline Kubernetes controller to use non-default CRDs.
- Fixed an issue when merging a route with multiple parentRefs.
- Fixed the reconciliation logic to continue processing all GatewayClasses even after encountering an error with one.
- Fixed the topology injector blocking the Envoy proxy from starting.
- Increased the shutdown-manager's `failureThreshold` to 10 to ensure Envoy restarts before shutdown-manager in the event of transient network issues.
- Fixed the issue where a `ReferenceGrant` from a `SecurityPolicy` to a referenced `remoteJWKS` backend was not respected.
- Added validation for header values.
- Added validation to prevent duplicated API keys in API Key Auth.
- Fixed `HTTPRoute` precedence by correctly considering header and query match types.
- Ensured the TLS inspector filter is only added to TCP listeners (not UDP/QUIC) when HTTP/3 is enabled via `ClientTrafficPolicy`, preventing nil pointer dereference.
